ROMHACK RACES README - Playtesting and Level Creation

If you are creating a level for us, or are interested in doing so in the future, please read the following information about our standards, 
playtesting process and collaboration efforts:

IMPORTANT:
By submitting your level to Romhack Races, you are giving us permission to feature your level in our season collaboration hack that is submitted to SMWCentral. 
You will be credited as the creator of your level in the submission and within the hack, 

In order to include the hack within the collaboration, the following guidelines must be followed:
- Global patches are strictly disallowed. If this raises an issue, please contact the playtesting team.
- No more than 6 MAP16 pages per level.
- If you use multiple MAP16 page, please fill the page before creating a new one.

If you do not wish to have your level featured in our collaboration hack, we ask that you create a level that you would be comfortable sharing. 
Additionally, please refrain from using your hack to explicitly promote upcoming or other creative works outside of the weekly race level.
------------------

PLAYTESTING:
If you aren't already in the level testing server on Discord, you will be sent an invitation to join when it is time to start testing your level. 
When you join, please post the patch for your level. Within 36 hours, our team of playtesters will test your level and provide 
feedback and suggested changes to be made, either aesthetically or functionally. 

We ask that you, as creator, make the changes the testers present as they are presented. 
We recognize that this is your level, not ours, and we are not trying to take away your creative freedom through our edits. 
Please understand that our goal is to make the level its best possible version, and we pride ourselves on maintaining a high standard for the levels we feature. 

Please do not take our feedback personally - we are very grateful you have taken the time and interest in being a creator, 
and want to help you have the best possible showing at the race!
------------------

REVISIONS:
Once the first round of testing is done, we ask that you have your revisions done within 48 hours of receiving feedback. 
We know that life doesn't stop for Romhack races, and we are more than willing to accommodate if you need extra time. 
That said, the sooner you are able to make changes, the sooner you can get further feedback from testers. 

While we are always trying to defer to you as the creator, there may be instances where the playtesters feel that specific revisions are necessary 
in order to feature the level as a race. In those instances, playtesters may provide edits on their own for you to note. 
If you refuse to make a revision that a consensus of playtesters feel is necessary, we reserve the right to not feature your level on Romhack Races.

Ideally, we aim to have your level finalized and ready to go at least 24 hours prior to the start of the race so that we aren't 
scrambling to make last-minute changes before posting the level. 
If we are late in the week and the playtesting team does not feel comfortable with the state of the level, we reserve the right to delay your race to a later week. 


DELIVERY: 
When playtesting is complete, please LOCK your level in lunar magic before sending it to us for distribution. 
Beyond your .smc file (we are able to post roms, but only within the level testing server), 
please take any customizations you have made to your level (music, blocks, sprites, uberASM, etc.) and package them in a ZIP file once the level is finalized. 

If you have any questions about the playtesting process, please ask within the playtesting server. 

Thank you again for creating a level, and we hope you're excited for your race!
