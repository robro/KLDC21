IMPORTANT INFORMATION

Make sure your rom is named BaseromV3.smc if you wanna apply save_common_patch_settings or it will give you errors.

If you insert custom title screen movement, re-apply save_common_patch_settings.bat by simply double clicking it. 
Otherwise the retry system doesnt function correctly anymore.

If you change anything in the retry_table or global settings, then also re-apply save_common_patch_settings.bat
