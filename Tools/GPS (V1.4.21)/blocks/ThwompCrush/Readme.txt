THWOMP CRUSH BLOCK
BY ROY
(ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH GPS)
-------------------

Q: What will this block do?
A: It will shatter when a Thwomp lands on top of it.
You have to use them as a pair of two blocks, the left one will destroy the right one when Thwomp comes into
contact with the pair.

Use them like in this example:

[T][T]
[T][T]

[B][B]

T = part of Thwomp
B = block

You can adjust the amount of time it takes Thwomp to get up, the sound effect, the amount of time the ground
shakes and if the brick pieces are flashing or if they're just brown.

You can also remove a part of the code, so that Thwomp doesn't rise up, but goes through the blocks directly.

Q: Which Map16 number does the block need to act like?
A: Preferably 130. (But not necessarily.)

Q: I found a bug.
A: Please report it!

Q: Credit needed?
A: No.
