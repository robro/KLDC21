; Change these to customize the autoscroll settings
!NoLRScroll     = 1     ;> 1 = no LR scroll, 0 = LR scroll enabled.
!Direction1     = 1     ;> 1 = vertical, 0 = horizontal.
!Direction2     = 1     ;> 1 = up/left, 0 = down/right.
!Teleport       = 0     ;> 1 = when the scroll stops, Mario will teleport based on the current screen exit.
!StartScreen    = $06   ;> Screen number where to start scrolling.
!StopScreen     = $00   ;> Screen number where to stop scrolling.
!Speed          = $00   ;> How many pixels to move each frame.
!FractionSpeed  = $80   ;\ Fractional speed, used if you want more fine-tuned speed (e.g. 1.5 speed, 0.5, etc.)
                        ;| Goes from $00 to $FF, where $FF is almost equal to !Speed = $01
                        ;| So for example if you want 1.5 speed, you'd use !Speed = $01 and !FractionSpeed = $80
                        ;/ and for 0.5 speed you'd use !Speed = $00 and !FractionSpeed = $80.
