;Overworld Level Tile Properties Fix - by Blind Devil
;This ASM file is meant to be placed in Gamemode E, in case your teleporting code is configured
;to activate an event, beat the level and teleport to other place in the OW (actions 5 or 6).
;It preserves the actual level destination flags and its usage is recommended, unless you want
;your level destination to enable moving and have is 'level has been passed' flag checked after
;the event is run.

;~FREE RAM~
;Well you will need something to be used temporarily as free RAM.
;It'll be used to preserve the OW level setting flags of the level destination.
