- Horizontal/Vertical level wraps, coded by Kaizoman666/Thomas. -
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The two UberASM codes are HorzWrap.asm and VertWrap.asm.
 - HorzWrap.asm will link the top and bottom of the screen. It's intended for horizontal levels.
 - VertWrap.asm will link the left and right sides of the screen. It's intended for vertical levels.
Open the files for any additional instructions/options for them.

The third included ASM file, VertWrapPrep.asm, is required for VertWrap.asm to work correctly.
 It should be applied directly with Asar, not through UberASM Tool.
 However, it only needs to be applied once.
