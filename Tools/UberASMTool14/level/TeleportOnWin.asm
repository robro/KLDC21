; Teleport on level end UberASM by KevinM                       ;

; This code will teleport the player when the level ends,       ;
; based on the current screen exit.                             ;
;                                                               ;
; It works for goal tapes, orbs, normal bosses and, thanks      ;
; to some magic, also mode 7 bosses like Reznor or Iggy.        ;
; In bosses that span multiple screens (including, for example, ;
; Ludwig) make sure the exit is set on all possible screens!    ;
; It also works for switch palaces, but the teleport will be    ;
; instantaneous even if using !TeleportType = 1.                ;
; It doesn't work for keyholes or inside the bonus game.        ;
;                                                               ;
; There's also an option to skip or not the bonus game, in case ;
; beating the current level gives you enough bonus coins.       ;
;===============================================================;

; 0 = teleport as soon as the level ends
; 1 = teleport only after the level end scorecard has ended
!TeleportType = 1

; 0 = if getting 100 bonus stars, you'll go to the bonus game and then to the overworld
; 1 = if getting 100 bonus stars, you'll be teleported anyway
!SkipBonusGame = 1
