This almost completely gets rid of the bonus stars. 
The bonus star counter is removed, and you will not
recieve any upon completion of a level. This should
be compatible with anything rom patched with anything.

Credit to pieguy for giving me the PC address.
Credit to me(Aiyo) for assbleming this.

HOW TO USE:
Use xkas or Asar to patch to your rom.
